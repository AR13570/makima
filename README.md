## Overview

Makima is a powerful, web-based Agent Framework designed for building and managing AI-powered conversational agents. It provides a flexible and extensible architecture for creating, deploying, and interacting with AI agents through a RESTful API.

## Features

- **Agent Management**: Create and configure AI agents with custom system prompts and tools
- **Thread Management**: Handle conversation threads and message history
- **Tool Integration**: Add and manage custom tools for agents to use
- **Knowledge Base**: Store and query vector embeddings for enhanced agent capabilities
- **Web Interface**: Manage agents and test them through an intuitive UI (WIP)

## Getting Started

Check out our [Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md) to begin working with Makima.

## Documentation

- [Core Concepts](docs/concepts.md)
- [API Documentation](docs/api/)

## Development Status

⚠️ **Please Note**: Makima is currently in active development (alpha stage). APIs and features may change frequently, and some functionality might be unstable. We recommend using this in non-production environments until we reach a stable release.

## TypeScript SDK

We provide an early alpha version of our TypeScript SDK to help you integrate Makima into your TypeScript/JavaScript applications more easily. Check out the [makima-ts repository](https://github.com/makima-ai/makima-ts) to get started with the SDK.

These additions will help set proper expectations for users and make them aware of the available SDK. Would you like me to provide the complete updated README.md file with these changes integrated?
