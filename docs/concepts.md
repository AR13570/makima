# Makima Core Concepts

This document outlines the key concepts and components of the Makima Agent Framework. Understanding these concepts will help you effectively use and extend Makima's capabilities.

## Agent

An Agent in Makima is a configurable AI entity designed to perform specific tasks or engage in conversations. Key characteristics of an Agent include:

- **Name**: A unique identifier for the agent.
- **Description**: A brief explanation of the agent's purpose or capabilities.
- **Prompt**: The system prompt that defines the agent's behavior and knowledge base.
- **Primary Model**: The main AI model used by the agent for generating responses.
- **Fallback Models**: Alternative models that can be used if the primary model is unavailable or unsuitable for a specific task.
- **Tools**: A set of functions or capabilities that the agent can use to perform tasks.

## Thread

A Thread represents a conversation or interaction session with an agent. It maintains the context and history of the interaction. Key aspects of a Thread include:

- **ID**: A unique identifier for the thread.
- **Platform**: The platform or context where the conversation is taking place (e.g., CLI, web, mobile app).
- **Messages**: A chronological list of messages exchanged in the thread.
- **Associated Agent**: The agent assigned to handle this thread.

## Message

A Message is a unit of communication within a Thread. Types of messages include:

- **Human Message**: Input from a user.
- **AI Message**: Response generated by the agent.
- **Tool Calls**: Requests from the AI to use specific tools.
- **Tool Responses**: Results returned from tool executions.

## Tool

A Tool is a function or capability that an agent can use to perform specific tasks or retrieve information. Tools extend the agent's abilities beyond simple text generation. Characteristics of a Tool include:

- **Name**: A unique identifier for the tool.
- **Description**: An explanation of what the tool does and how to use it.
- **Parameters**: The input schema required to use the tool.
- **Endpoint**: The API endpoint where the tool functionality is implemented.
- **Method**: The HTTP method used to call the tool (e.g., GET, POST).

## Knowledge Base

A Knowledge Base in Makima is an independent and versatile component for storing and managing vector embeddings. It is not tied to specific agents or threads and can be used for various vector-based operations. Key aspects include:

- **Name**: A unique identifier for the knowledge base.
- **Description**: An explanation of the type of information stored in the knowledge base.
- **Embedding Model**: The model used to generate vector embeddings of the stored data.
- **Database Provider**: The backend used to store and query the vector embeddings (e.g., pgvector).

Knowledge Bases can be utilized for a wide range of applications, including but not limited to:

- Semantic search across large datasets
- Data clustering and categorization
- Enhancing agent responses with relevant information
- Similarity comparisons between different pieces of content

The flexibility of Knowledge Bases allows them to be integrated into various parts of your application or used independently for data analysis and information retrieval tasks.

## Context

Context refers to the metadata and environment in which an interaction occurs. It can include information about:

- The platform where the interaction is taking place.
- User-specific data or preferences.
- Any relevant session information.

Understanding these core concepts will help you navigate the Makima framework more effectively, allowing you to create sophisticated AI agents, manage conversations, and extend the system's capabilities through custom tools and knowledge bases.
